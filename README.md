# spdnet-autoencoder

## Introduction

### Goal

The goal of this project is to implement an autoencoder for SPD matrices. SPD matrices, such like covariances matrices, which are often used to represent EEG data have properties than we can try to use in our model to better represent them.

## Explication

In this section you will find the explication of the projects. You have three folders : data, models, src

In /data, you will find the datas generated by this program. By default, there is synthetic dataloaders that were created using synthetic_data_block_diag.py. If you generate other data, you wil find them here. The nomenclature used is
synthetic-dataloader + method_of_generation + train/test/val + index
Two dataset with the same method of generation and same index are created using the same code, and they are split using a random train test val.

In /models, you will find the information of the models you created. You will have one example of the first matrix of the last batch for the tree splits given as an image format, the datas saved as .pt format, the model saved as .pth format if you need them for a future utilisation.

In /src , you will find the source code of this program.

## Utilisation 

In this section you will find information about how to use this program.

### Generate a model
Some data are present by default. If you need to generate new data, you can run :
cd src/
python3 generate_synthetic_data
There are parameters by default that you can see in "src/generate_synthetic_data.py".

If you want to change the parameters, please see the different arguments here :
python3 generate_synthetic_data.py --help

You will find your datas in the folder /data/

### Train a model
A first example you can run is :
cd src/
python3 pipeline.py
There are parameters by default that you can see in "src/pipeline.py".

If you want to change the parameters, please see the different arguments here :
python3 pipeline.py --help

Please note that :
- the parameter INDEX requires the DATA to be "synthetic", it is set to "synthetic" by default so you do not need to specify it.
- the parameter SYNTHETIC_GENERATION requires the DATA to be "synthetic", it is set to "synthetic" by default so you do not need to specify it.
- the parameter LAYERS has to be >1 and requires the LAYERS_TYPE to be set to "regular"
- the parameter NOISE if used with DATA="synthetic" needs the data to have a noise.
